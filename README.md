# Finding QR Decomposition using Householder Transformations

A numerically stable Householder reflections algorithm for computing QR decomposition of matrix A.

## Running instructions
-----------------
### QR decomposition
To compute QR decomposition using householder reflections, run the matlab file `qr_decomposition_house_holder.m` and verify the constraints.

### Stability experiment
To verify the numerical stability of QR decomposition using Householder reflections, run the matlab file `stability.m`. A presaved stability plot can be found in `stability.png` file.
